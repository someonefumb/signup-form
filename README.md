# Sign Up Form
Sign up form for oranges (placeholder maybe).

## Reflection
This was fairly easy however I was busy with irl stuff so it was delayed for 2 weeks. 

I had trouble deciding on some measurements and that ultimately took some research to fix. For example, I had the picture as height:100vh but when I implemented the form's height, the picture wasn't scaling, so I switched to min-height:100vh.

The other difficult part was styling invalidness for inputs with different selectors doing different things, so that also took some time. I also haven't touched up on regex, so I had to search up some patterns for the inputs to work.
